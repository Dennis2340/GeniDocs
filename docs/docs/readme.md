## Dependencies

There are no explicit dependencies mentioned in the provided `README.md` snippet. However, if this project involves Go programming, it is likely dependent on the Go toolchain (compiler, runtime, etc.), which should be installed as a prerequisite. Additional dependencies, such as external Go modules or libraries, would typically be listed in a `go.mod` file or within the `README.md` if relevant.

## Notes for Maintainers

If you are maintaining this repository, consider updating the `README.md` with detailed sections as outlined above to improve user experience and project accessibility. This file is often rendered on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, so use Markdown formatting (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.) to ensure readability.

For Docusaurus integration, if this `README.md` is part of a larger documentation site, ensure it adheres to Docusaurus Markdown conventions and is placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., `docs/` folder) or linked from a sidebar configuration.
